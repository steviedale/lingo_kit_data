- plan database structure
- plan lingo kit creation (adding/removing terms, searching, etc)
- finish running generation
- create a script to collect all of the topics for each english/italian base lemma and then feed it to a LLM to consolidate topics
- budget audio creation:
    - check how much we've spent on audio
    - get estimate on cost of regeneration
    - consider limited generate (maybe not all of the forms of nouns/verbs/adjectives for now)
