I want you to generate a CSV text (don't use code to generate) that captures the main variations of a few Italian adjectives that I provide you with, in the exact structure below.

The CSV must have the following columns in this order:

term_italian,is_base,base_term_italian,translation_english,topics,gender,plurality,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english

Column definitions:

term_italian: the Italian word form (e.g. bello, bella, grandi).

is_base: true only for the base form (masculine singular), otherwise false.

base_term_italian: always the lemma (masculine singular form).

translation_english: the English meaning (e.g. beautiful, large).

topics: a short list (in quotes) of 1–3 general topics related to this adjective, separated by commas (e.g. "appearance, evaluation"). All rows with the same base_term_italian must share the same topics list.

gender: one of “masculine”, “feminine”, or “n/a” (for invariable adjectives).

plurality: either “singular”, “plural”, or “n/a” (for invariable adjectives).

notes: short clarifications (e.g. “invariable”, “irregular plural”, “used before vowels”).

example_sentence_italian: a short, natural Italian sentence using this exact form.

example_sentence_english: the English translation of the example sentence.

Formatting rules:

Return the CSV as plain text only, not as a code block.

Each row should represent exactly one adjective form.

The base row must always be the masculine singular form.

Expand gender and plurality explicitly (“masculine”, “feminine”, “singular”, “plural”).

Use consistent lowercase true/false in the boolean column is_base.

For adjectives that change with gender/number, include all four forms (masculine singular, masculine plural, feminine singular, feminine plural).

For invariable adjectives, include both singular and plural if applicable, marking gender as n/a.

Provide natural, everyday example sentences for each form.

Example (full):

term_italian,is_base,base_term_italian,translation_english,topics,gender,plurality,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english
bello,true,bello,beautiful,"appearance,evaluation",masculine,singular,,Il ragazzo è bello.,The boy is handsome.
