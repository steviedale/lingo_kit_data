I want you to generate a CSV text (don't use code to generate) that captures the main variations of an Italian adjective in the exact structure below.

The CSV must have the following columns in this order:

term_italian,is_base,base_word_italian,translation_english,gender,plurality,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english

Column definitions:

term_italian: the Italian word form (e.g. bello, bella, grandi).

is_base: true only for the base form (masculine singular), otherwise false.

base_word_italian: always the lemma (masculine singular form).

translation_english: the English meaning (e.g. beautiful, large).

gender: one of “masculine”, “feminine”, or “n/a” (for invariable adjectives).

plurality: either “singular”, “plural”, or “n/a” (for invariable adjectives).

notes: short clarifications (e.g. “invariable”, “irregular plural”, “used before vowels”).

example_sentence_italian: a short, natural Italian sentence using this exact form.

example_sentence_english: the English translation of the example sentence.

Formatting rules:

Return the CSV as plain text only, not as a code block.

Each row should represent exactly one adjective form.

The base row must always be the masculine singular form.

Expand gender and plurality explicitly (“masculine”, “feminine”, “singular”, “plural”).

Use consistent lowercase true/false in the boolean column is_base.

For adjectives that change with gender/number, include all four forms (masculine singular, masculine plural, feminine singular, feminine plural).

For invariable adjectives, include both singular and plural if applicable, marking gender as n/a.

Provide natural, everyday example sentences for each form.

Example (full):

term_italian,is_base,base_word_italian,translation_english,gender,plurality,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english
bello,true,bello,beautiful,masculine,singular,,Il ragazzo è bello.,The boy is handsome.
bella,false,bello,beautiful,feminine,singular,,La casa è bella.,The house is beautiful.
belli,false,bello,beautiful,masculine,plural,,I fiori sono belli.,The flowers are beautiful.
belle,false,bello,beautiful,feminine,plural,,Le città sono belle.,The cities are beautiful.
grande,true,grande,big,n/a,singular,invariable by gender,Il gatto è grande.,The cat is big.
grandi,false,grande,big,n/a,plural,invariable by gender,I cani sono grandi.,The dogs are big.

Now generate this full CSV text for the adjective [ADJECTIVE] meaning "[ENGLISH TRANSLATION]".

Please output only the CSV text, nothing else.
