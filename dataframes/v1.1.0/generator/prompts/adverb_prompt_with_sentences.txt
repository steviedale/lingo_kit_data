I want you to generate a CSV text (don't use code to generate) that captures the main details of an Italian adverb in the exact structure below.

The CSV must have the following columns in this order:
term_italian,is_base,base_word_italian,translation_english,topics,is_comparative,is_superlative,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english

Column definitions:

term_italian: the Italian adverb form (e.g. velocemente, bene).

is_base: true only for the main/base adverb form, otherwise false.

base_word_italian: always the base lemma of the adverb (typically same as term_italian).

translation_english: the English meaning of the adverb (e.g. quickly, well).

topics: a short list (in quotes) of 1–3 general topics related to this adverb, separated by commas (e.g. "manner, speed"). All rows with the same base_word_italian must share the same topics list.

is_comparative: true if the row represents a comparative form, otherwise false.

is_superlative: true if the row represents a superlative form (including intensifiers), otherwise false.

notes: short clarifications (e.g. “irregular comparative form,” “derived from adjective X,” or “used mainly in spoken Italian”).

example_sentence_italian: a short, natural Italian sentence using this exact adverb form.

example_sentence_english: the English translation of the example sentence.

Formatting rules:

Return the CSV as plain text only, not as a code block.

Each row should represent exactly one adverb form.

Use consistent lowercase true/false in the boolean columns.

Always include the base form plus comparative and superlative forms (if applicable).

If multiple superlative intensifiers exist (e.g. assolutamente, fortissimo), include them as separate rows marked is_base=false and is_superlative=true.

If the adverb is invariable (no comparative/superlative), mark is_comparative=false and is_superlative=false.

Grouping rules (important):

Only group adverbs under the same base_word_italian if they are slight, visible variations of the base form (e.g. formed by adding a suffix like -issimo, a prefix like stra-, or intensifiers like molto velocemente).

Do not group words that have a different-looking root/stem, even if semantically related. For example:

male → malissimo ✅ (works)

male → pessimamente ❌ (doesn’t work)

bene → benissimo ✅ (works)

bene → ottimamente ❌ (doesn’t work)

Irregular forms that do not look like the base adverb (male → peggio, bene → meglio) must be treated as their own independent base adverbs with is_base=true.

Checklist of forms to include (baseline set):

Base adverb form.

Comparative form (if it exists).

Superlative form(s), including intensifiers (if they exist).

Example (full):

term_italian,is_base,base_word_italian,translation_english,topics,is_comparative,is_superlative,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english
bene,true,bene,well,"manner,quality",false,false,irregular comparative/superlative,"Lui parla bene l'italiano.","He speaks Italian well."
benissimo,false,bene,very well,"manner,quality",false,true,absolute superlative,"Hai cantato benissimo.","You sang very well."
molto bene,false,bene,very well,"manner,quality",false,true,intensifier + base,"Parla molto bene il francese.","He speaks French very well."
male,true,male,badly,"manner,quality",false,false,irregular comparative peggio; superlative formed with -issimo,"Lui gioca male a calcio.","He plays football badly."
malissimo,false,male,very badly,"manner,quality",false,true,absolute superlative,"Ha cantato malissimo alla festa.","He sang very badly at the party."

Now generate this full CSV text for the adverb [ADVERB] meaning "[ENGLISH TRANSLATION]".

Please output only the csv text, nothing else.
