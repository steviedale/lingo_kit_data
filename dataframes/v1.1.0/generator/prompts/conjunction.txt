I want you to generate a CSV text (don't use code to generate) that captures the main details of an Italian conjunction in the exact structure below.

The CSV must have the following columns in this order:
term_italian,is_base,base_word_italian,translation_english,topics,conjunction_type,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english

Column definitions:

term_italian: the Italian conjunction (e.g., e, ma, perché).

is_base: true for the most basic/common form, otherwise false.

base_word_italian: usually the same as term_italian, unless it's a slight variation.

translation_english: English meaning (e.g., and, but, because). If the value contains a comma, wrap the whole value in quotes.

topics: a short list of 1–3 general topics related to the term.

The list must be surrounded in quotes.

Topics must be comma-separated.

Topics must not contain spaces (e.g., "core,logic" or "feelings,explanations").

conjunction_type: coordinating, subordinating, correlative.

notes: special remarks or usage notes. If the value contains a comma, wrap the whole value in quotes.

example_sentence_italian: a simple Italian sentence showing usage. If the value contains a comma, wrap the whole value in quotes.

example_sentence_english: the translation of that sentence. If the value contains a comma, wrap the whole value in quotes.

Important formatting rule: Any value that contains a comma must be wrapped in quotes to preserve the CSV structure.

Now generate this full CSV text for the conjunction [CONJUNCTION].

Please output only the csv text, nothing else.
