### Adjective
I want you to generate a CSV text (don't use code to generate) that captures the main variations of an Italian adjective in the exact structure below.

The CSV must have the following columns in this order:

term_italian,is_base,base_term_italian,translation_english,topics,gender,plurality,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english

Column definitions:

term_italian: the Italian word form (e.g. bello, bella, grandi).

is_base: true only for the base form (masculine singular), otherwise false.

base_term_italian: always the lemma (masculine singular form).

translation_english: the English meaning (e.g. beautiful, large).

topics: a short list (in quotes) of 1–3 general topics related to this adjective, separated by commas (e.g. "appearance, evaluation"). All rows with the same base_term_italian must share the same topics list.

gender: one of “masculine”, “feminine”, or “n/a” (for invariable adjectives).

plurality: either “singular”, “plural”, or “n/a” (for invariable adjectives).

notes: short clarifications (e.g. “invariable”, “irregular plural”, “used before vowels”).

example_sentence_italian: a short, natural Italian sentence using this exact form.

example_sentence_english: the English translation of the example sentence.

Formatting rules:

Return the CSV as plain text only, not as a code block.

Each row should represent exactly one adjective form.

The base row must always be the masculine singular form.

Expand gender and plurality explicitly (“masculine”, “feminine”, “singular”, “plural”).

Use consistent lowercase true/false in the boolean column is_base.

For adjectives that change with gender/number, include all four forms (masculine singular, masculine plural, feminine singular, feminine plural).

For invariable adjectives, include both singular and plural if applicable, marking gender as n/a.

Provide natural, everyday example sentences for each form.

Example (full):

term_italian,is_base,base_term_italian,translation_english,topics,gender,plurality,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english
bello,true,bello,beautiful,"appearance,evaluation",masculine,singular,,Il ragazzo è bello.,The boy is handsome.
bella,false,bello,beautiful,"appearance,evaluation",feminine,singular,,La casa è bella.,The house is beautiful.
belli,false,bello,beautiful,"appearance,evaluation",masculine,plural,,I fiori sono belli.,The flowers are beautiful.
belle,false,bello,beautiful,"appearance,evaluation",feminine,plural,,Le città sono belle.,The cities are beautiful.
grande,true,grande,big,"size",n/a,singular,invariable by gender,Il gatto è grande.,The cat is big.
grandi,false,grande,big,"size",n/a,plural,invariable by gender,I cani sono grandi.,The dogs are big.

The CSV must have the following columns in this order:

Column definitions:

term_italian: the Italian adverb form (e.g. velocemente, bene).

is_base: true only for the main/base adverb form, otherwise false.

base_term_italian: always the base lemma of the adverb (typically same as term_italian).

translation_english: the English meaning of the adverb (e.g. quickly, well).

topics: a short list (in quotes) of 1–3 general topics related to this adverb, separated by commas (e.g. "manner, speed"). All rows with the same base_term_italian must share the same topics list.

is_comparative: true if the row represents a comparative form, otherwise false.

is_superlative: true if the row represents a superlative form (including intensifiers), otherwise false.

notes: short clarifications (e.g. “irregular comparative form,” “derived from adjective X,” or “used mainly in spoken Italian”).

example_sentence_english: the English translation of the example sentence.

Formatting rules:

Return the CSV as plain text only, not as a code block.

Each row should represent exactly one adverb form.

Use consistent lowercase true/false in the boolean columns.

Always include the base form plus comparative and superlative forms (if applicable).

If multiple superlative intensifiers exist (e.g. assolutamente, fortissimo), include them as separate rows marked is_base=false and is_superlative=true.

If the adverb is invariable (no comparative/superlative), mark is_comparative=false and is_superlative=false.

Grouping rules (important):

Only group adverbs under the same base_term_italian if they are slight, visible variations of the base form (e.g. formed by adding a suffix like -issimo, a prefix like stra-, or intensifiers like molto velocemente).

Do not group words that have a different-looking root/stem, even if semantically related. For example:

male → malissimo ✅ (works)

male → pessimamente ❌ (doesn't work)

bene → benissimo ✅ (works)

bene → ottimamente ❌ (doesn't work)

Irregular forms that do not look like the base adverb (male → peggio, bene → meglio) must be treated as their own independent base adverbs with is_base=true.

Checklist of forms to include (baseline set):

Base adverb form.

Comparative form (if it exists).

Superlative form(s), including intensifiers (if they exist).

Example (full):

term_italian,is_base,base_term_italian,translation_english,topics,is_comparative,is_superlative,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english
