You are generating plain-text CSV (not a code block) in a single unified schema for the Italian word [ITALIAN WORD] meaning "[SHORT ENGLISH GLOSS]".
If the word can belong to multiple parts of speech, produce all applicable POS families (grouped by lemma) in one CSV output, following the rules below.

1) Output format (exact header and order)

Output only CSV text using this header exactly:

term_italian,is_base,base_lemma_italian,part_of_speech,translation_english,topics,subtype,person_number,gender,plurality,mood,tense,is_comparative,is_superlative,is_compound,article_type,article_italian,added_particle_italian,preposition,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english


Every row is one concrete surface form (e.g., i gatti, benissimo, che).

If a field is not applicable, write n/a (for booleans, write false).

Use lowercase true/false consistently.

Provide natural, everyday example sentences in Italian + English for each row’s exact form.

Use the same topics string for all rows of the same base lemma.

If any value contains a comma, wrap that value in quotes to preserve CSV integrity.

2) Field definitions & allowed values

term_italian: concrete word/phrase form for the row.

is_base: true only for the canonical/base form of that POS family; otherwise false.

base_lemma_italian: canonical lemma for that POS family (e.g., nouns/adj = lemma; verbs = infinitive; adverbs = base adverb; pronouns/determiners/articles/prepositions/conjunctions = simplest base form).

part_of_speech: one of
adjective, adverb, article, conjunction, determiner, noun, preposition, pronoun, verb.

translation_english: concise meaning for this form (e.g., “some cats”, “I am”, “very well”).

topics: quoted, comma-separated tags (1–3), no spaces (e.g., "core,people" or "manner,quality").

subtype (secondary type; else n/a):

article → definite | indefinite | partitive

preposition → simple | articulated

determiner → demonstrative | possessive | quantifier | distributive

conjunction → coordinating | subordinating | correlative

pronoun → pronoun kind (personal, reflexive, direct_object, indirect_object, demonstrative, possessive, …)

others → n/a

person_number: 1s,2s,3s,1p,2p,3p,n/a

gender: masculine, feminine, n/a

plurality: singular, plural, n/a

mood,tense: only for verbs; otherwise n/a

is_comparative,is_superlative: only for adverbs (else false)

is_compound: true only for verbs’ compound forms (else false)

article_type,article_italian,added_particle_italian,preposition: used for noun rows (else n/a)

notes: short clarifications (e.g., “irregular plural”, “also ‘you (formal)’”, “contraction of con + il”).

example_sentence_italian / example_sentence_english: short and natural; must match term_italian.

3) POS-specific generation rules (inherit from prior specs)

Follow these rules when that POS applies to [ITALIAN WORD]. If the word does not belong to a POS, omit that POS family entirely.

A) Adjective

Rows: include all four forms if variable: masculine/feminine × singular/plural.
For invariable adjectives: include singular & plural with gender = n/a where appropriate.

Base row is masculine singular form (is_base=true).

Keep one topics list across all forms for the lemma.

B) Adverb

Include:

base adverb form (is_base=true);

comparative (if exists) → set is_comparative=true;

superlative/intensified variants (e.g., -issimo, intensifiers like molto X) → one row each with is_superlative=true.

Grouping rule: Group only forms that are visible morphological/intensifier variants of the same base (e.g., bene → benissimo, molto bene).
Irregulars with different roots (e.g., male → peggio, bene → meglio) become their own base lemmas (is_base=true) in separate POS families.

C) Article

Include the form(s) of the given article family with:

subtype = definite | indefinite | partitive

gender / plurality as appropriate.

Use notes for special phonetic/orthographic contexts (e.g., before vowels).

D) Conjunction

subtype = coordinating | subordinating | correlative.

Use quotes in CSV if the example or translation contains commas.

E) Determiner (excluding articles)

subtype = demonstrative | possessive | quantifier | distributive.

Fill gender / plurality appropriately (e.g., questo/questa/questi/queste as separate rows).

F) Noun

Always include at least:

Bare lemma (singular, no article) → article_type=n/a, article_italian=n/a, added_particle_italian=n/a, preposition=n/a, is_base=true.

Indefinite singular (un/uno/una/un’).

Definite singular (il/lo/la/l’).

Bare plural.

Definite plural (i/gli/le).

Indefinite plural / partitive (dei/degli/delle).

All articulated prepositions for di, a, da, in, su, con with correct singular and plural contractions (e.g., del,della,dell’,dei,degli,delle; al,allo,all’,ai,agli,alle; col,coi etc.).

Fill: article_type=articulated_preposition, article_italian = contracted article piece,
added_particle_italian = exact added piece (e.g., del, alla), preposition = simple preposition (di/a/da/in/su/con).

Use notes for irregular plurals, invariable forms, mass nouns, contractions, archaic/rare, etc.

G) Preposition

subtype = simple or articulated.

For articulated forms, generate rows for the correct contractions (match gender/number where relevant) and provide examples.

H) Pronoun

subtype = pronoun kind (personal, reflexive, direct_object, indirect_object, demonstrative, possessive, …).

If a pronoun has multiple functions, create separate rows per function (same term if appropriate).

Person mapping: 1s=io, 2s=tu, 3s=lui/lei/Lei, 1p=noi, 2p=voi, 3p=loro.
For “you”:

Lei → translation “you (formal)”, person_number=2s.

tu → “you” (informal singular).

voi → “you (plural)”.

Set gender/number when the form itself encodes it; otherwise n/a.

I) Verb

Base row: infinitive with is_base=true, mood=non-finite, tense=infinitive, person_number=n/a, gender=n/a, plurality=n/a, is_compound=false.

Include:

Gerund and participles (list all four participle gender/number variants).

Indicative present: all 6 persons.

Indicative imperfect: all 6 persons.

Indicative passato prossimo: all person × gender/number agreement rows, is_compound=true.
Include note “used with auxiliary X” if relevant; for 3rd person singular forms that serve as you (formal), note that too.

4) Disambiguation & coverage

If [ITALIAN WORD] belongs to multiple POS (e.g., determiner & pronoun), produce separate POS families (sharing the same base_lemma_italian if the lemma truly matches).

If no forms exist for a rule (e.g., an invariable adjective), still include the necessary rows with n/a where appropriate and clarify in notes.

Keep examples short and natural, matching each exact term_italian.
