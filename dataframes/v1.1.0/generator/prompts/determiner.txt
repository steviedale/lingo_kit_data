I want you to generate a CSV text (don't use code to generate) that captures the main details of an Italian determiner (excluding articles) in the exact structure below.

The CSV must have the following columns in this order:
term_italian,is_base,base_word_italian,translation_english,topics,determiner_type,gender,plurality,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english

Column definitions:

term_italian: the Italian determiner (e.g., questo, quella, mio, alcuni, ogni).

is_base: true only for the most basic/common form, otherwise false.

base_word_italian: the root determiner form (e.g., questo, mio, qualche).

translation_english: the English meaning (e.g., this, my, some, every).

topics: a short list of 1â€“3 general topics related to the term.

The list must be surrounded in quotes.

Topics must be comma-separated.

Topics must not contain spaces (e.g., "core,family" or "shopping,quantities").

determiner_type: demonstrative, possessive, quantifier, distributive.

gender: masculine, feminine, or n/a.

plurality: singular, plural, or n/a.

notes: special remarks or usage notes.

example_sentence_italian: a simple Italian sentence showing usage.

example_sentence_english: the translation of that sentence.

Now generate this full CSV text for the determiner [DETERMINER].

Please output only the csv text, nothing else.
