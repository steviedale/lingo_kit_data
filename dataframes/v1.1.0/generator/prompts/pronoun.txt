I want you to generate a CSV text (don't use code to generate) that captures the main details of an Italian pronoun in the exact structure below.

The CSV must have the following columns in this order:
term_italian,is_base,base_word_italian,translation_english,topics,pronoun_kind,person_number,gender,plurality,notes,example_sentence_italian,example_sentence_english

Column definitions:

term_italian: the Italian pronoun form (e.g., io, lui, noi).

is_base: true only for the most basic/common form of the pronoun, otherwise false.

base_word_italian: the lemma/group representative form (usually the simplest).

translation_english: the English meaning (e.g., I, he, we).

For “you”, follow these rules:

Use “you (formal)” for the formal singular pronoun (Lei).

Use just “you” for informal singular (tu).

Use “you (plural)” for voi.

topics: a short list of 1–3 general topics related to the term.

The list must be surrounded in quotes.

Topics must be comma-separated.

Topics must not contain spaces (e.g., "core,people,introductions" or "food,dinner").

pronoun_kind: the type of pronoun (personal, reflexive, direct_object, indirect_object, demonstrative, possessive, etc.).

⚠️ If a pronoun has multiple functions, each function must be listed in a separate row.

Example: loro would appear once as personal and again as indirect_object, with all other values repeated as needed.

person_number: if applicable, 1s, 2s, 3s, 1p, 2p, 3p; use n/a if not applicable.

gender: masculine, feminine, or n/a.

plurality: singular, plural, or n/a.

notes: brief usage notes or restrictions.

example_sentence_italian: a simple Italian sentence showing usage.

example_sentence_english: the translation of that sentence.
