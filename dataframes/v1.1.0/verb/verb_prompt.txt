I want you to generate a CSV text (don't use code to generate) that captures the main variations of an Italian verb in the exact structure below.

The CSV must have the following columns in this order:

term_italian,is_base,base_word_italian,translation_english,mood,tense,person_number,gender,plurality,is_compound,notes

Column definitions:

term_italian: the Italian word form (e.g. essere, sono, ero).

is_base: true only for the infinitive/base form, otherwise false.

base_word_italian: always the infinitive (lemma) of the verb.

translation_english: the English meaning of the form (e.g. I am, he was).

mood: one of non-finite, indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative.

tense: for example infinitive, gerund, participle, present, imperfect, passato_prossimo.

person_number: use compact codes: "1s", "2s", "3s", "1p", "2p", "3p", or "n/a" if not applicable.
    - "1s" (1st singular = io)
    - "2s" (2nd singular = tu)
    - "3s" (3rd singular = lui/lei/Lei)
    - "1p" (noi)
    - "2p" (voi)
    - "3p" (loro)
    - "n/a" (for infinitive, participles, etc. with no person/number)

gender: write out in full ("masculine", "feminine", or "n/a" if not applicable).

plurality: either "singular", "plural", or "n/a" if not applicable.

is_compound: "true" for compound tenses (e.g. sono stato), otherwise "false".

notes: short clarifications (e.g. “also 'you (formal)'”, or “used with auxiliary 'essere' to form compound tenses”).

Formatting rules:

Return the CSV as plain text only, not as a code block.

Each row should represent exactly one word form.

Expand gender/number labels fully (masculine, feminine, singular, plural).

Use consistent lowercase true/false in the boolean columns.

For participles, list all four gender/number variants.

For compound tenses, include separate rows for each gender/number form.

Include notes about “you (formal)” on 3rd person singular forms only.

Checklist of forms to include (baseline set):

Non-finite: infinitive, gerund, participles (masculine/feminine × singular/plural).

Indicative present: all 6 persons.

Indicative imperfect: all 6 persons.

Indicative passato prossimo: all persons × gender/number agreement.
